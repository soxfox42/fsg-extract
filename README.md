# fsg-extractor

A cross platform utility to extract the DISC0.IMG files found on DJ Hero 2 game discs, sometimes known as the FSG IMG format.

I wrote this because [the recommended tool](https://github.com/maxton/GameArchives) for extracting these files is Windows-only due to its use of WinForms. (Technically it also runs under Mono on Linux, but not on macOS as Mono is yet to port WinForms to 64-bit.)
